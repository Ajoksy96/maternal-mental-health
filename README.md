# What factors contribute to maternal mental health?
Between 1987 and 2018, pregnancy-related mortality (maternal mortality during pregnancy, delivery, and up to a year postpartum) has increased in the United States. Mental health conditions, including substance use and suicide, were leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths from 2017 to 2019. To understand causes for the increasing pregnancy-related mortality rates in the U.S., it is vital to examine factors related to maternal mental health. In particular, I was interested in examining the most important predictors of maternal mental health outcomes.

### The goal of this project was to examine the factors that are associated with maternal mental health outcomes.
